Feature: Create triples
  In order to have better data
  As a user
  I want parse files into n-triples

  # Scenario Outline: Load a file
  #   When I run "RAILS_ENV=development bundle exec rake generate:triples[metadata/<filename>]"
  #   Then the output should contain "<output>"
  #   Examples:
  #     | filename | output |
  #     | rattus_qtls_mp | Processing: metadata/rattus_qtls_mp |
  #     | cheeseburger | You must include the file to parse. |
  #
